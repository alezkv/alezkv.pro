A visually striking hero image for an article about implementing disaster recovery for Vaultwarden in a Kubernetes setup. The image should include elements such as the Kubernetes logo, Vaultwarden logo, and icons representing backup and recovery (e.g., a shield, cloud storage, and arrows indicating data flow). The background should evoke a sense of security and technology, with a dark blue or black gradient. The overall design should be modern and clean, conveying the themes of data protection and resilience.
